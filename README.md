## Bike Sharing Project – Des Monies 

### Project Overview

Investors needs to be convinced that a bike-sharing business in Des Monies is a solid business initiative. A bike trip analysis will upgrade the proposal and impress stakeholders. This analysis will require us to use Panda to change the “tripduration” column form an integer to a datetime datatype. The converted datatype will be used to create a set of visualization, such as:

Display the length of time bikes get checked out for all riders and genders, show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Lastly, we’ll include these new visualizations to our final presentation to convince stakeholders

### Resources 

•	Source: NYC_CitiBike_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb, NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb and 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv
•	Data Tools: Jupyter Notebook, CSV, Tableau and IO (Web Server)
•	Software: Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code 1.67.2

### Deliverable 1:

Change Trip Duration to a Date-time Format 

The data in the “tripduration” column is converted to a datetime datayppe and has the proper time format and the DataFrame is exported as a new file without the index column
